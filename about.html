            <h2 class="bg-blue " id="txt">History of Our Lady of Guadalupe Parish-Adams Catholic Church</h2>
            <p class="fst-italic py-4">          
On 14th December 1965, at the conclusion of the Vatican Council II when the Church was essentially defined as missionary, the first priest from Guadalupe Fathers arrived in Kenya to collaborate in the evangelizing task in the then Diocese of Kisumu.  On 21st February 1966, Fr. Emerenciano Rodriguez became the first Guadalupe Missionary Parish Priest of Amukura Mission, Busia District at the time. <br>
On 30th December 1968, Guadalupe Fathers came to Nairobi being a central and convenient place, searching for a house that would serve as a regional residence.  As fate would have it, though, the then Bishop of Nairobi, Rt. Rev. John Joseph McCarthy instead offered them a piece of land on which to open a Mission and construct a house.  <br>
And so it was that an agreement between the Diocese of Nairobi and Guadalupe Missionaries was signed for the subsequent establishment of a Mission in Woodley area, to respond to both spiritual and socio-economic needs of families within Woodley and Jamhuri estates as well as the greater Kibera informal settlement. The Christians used to call and refer to the priests as Wazungu wa Guadalupe; loosely translated as “The White men (read Missionaries) of Guadalupe”. <br>
During the Feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe 12th December, 1970, Bishop Maurice Michael Otunga (+), who had succeeded Archbishop McCarthy, did the official ground-breaking of the Church. During his speech, Cardinal Otunga said, “Today, we are happy to celebrate our Blessed Mother Mary for accepting us to build for her Son a house where, as Kenyan family we will be able to celebrate His redemption.  I urge the Guadalupe Fathers to dedicate this place as a Shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Kenya”.   That is how the name Our Lady of Guadalupe began and was assigned to this Church.  <br>
The foundation stone of the new mission was blessed by His Eminence Maurice Michael Cardinal Otunga and laid on 29th September 1973, by Hon. James Maina Wanjigi, who was the Member of Parliament for Langata Constituency under which the Mission fell.  <br>

Between 1968 and 1977, Sunday celebrations of Mass and catechism classes used to be held at Nairobi Girls’ School, currently known as Moi Girls’ Secondary School, Nairobi.  Once every month, the Mass would be celebrated alternately in members’ houses.  During weekdays the Priests and a few Christians would visit and pray with Christians in their houses.  This continued until 1977 when the church was completed. <br>
As the community continued expanding, the priest invited these communities to form a Council that would assist the missionaries in their work. The first Council formed in 1977 was composed as follows: <br>
<ol>
  <li>Chairman		Mr. Chrispine Ageyo Kotengo </li>
  <li>Secretary		Mrs. Mary Adams </li>
  <li>Treasurer		Mr. John Makona </li>
  <li>Asst. Secretary	Mr. Joseph Ochieng </li>
</ol> <br>
As the mission expanded, it became evident that more land was needed.  So, through the influence of the Servant of God Maurice Cardinal Otunga, and assistance from Mr. Francis Lubembe (now deceased), Mr. Joseph Ochieng, Mr. Francis Maragia, Ambassador Emmah Murai, Mrs. Ruth Nthiani and Mr. Chrispine Agweyo K’Otengo; the Vice President of the Republic of Kenya at that time – His Excellency Daniel Toroitich arap Moi - offered Guadalupe Fathers a piece of land on which other Parish structures stand today. <br>
After the Church building was completed, we started having two Eucharistic celebrations on Sundays; the Kiswahili Mass at 10.00 am and the Spanish Mass at 4.30pm.  Today, with an increased population and demand, we have six Sunday Masses at Woodley.  We also have three Masses celebrated every Sunday at Our Lady of Lourdes, Olympic and two each at St. Thomas, Makina and St. Luke, Kianda.  The relationship between Moi Girls’ and the Parish still stands as there are is still Masses at the school for students and staff, as well as catechism classes every Sunday of the school term. <br>
Following the AMECEA Bishops’ desire to have Small Christian Communities (SCC) initiated in parishes to strengthen the pastoral ministry, Fr. Joseph Sanabria and Fr. Sergio Espinoza encouraged the Christians of Guadalupe to start these communities.  As a result, the initial prayer groups were upgraded to form the Small Christian Communities of St. Joseph the Worker (Woodley/Jamhuri), St. Jude (Olympic), St. Luke (Kianda) and St. Andrew (Makina) in 1985.  To date, we have 60 vibrant Small Christian Communities.  Besides, the Parish has grown in leaps and bounds in terms of apostolate and structural facilities.  <br>
From 2006, when Fr. Raul Nava Trujillo took over from the long-serving Fr. Ricardo Gomez, the parish took a new turn in its approach and structure.  After a successful social analysis and for the first time ever, we had a Three-Year Strategic Plan of Evangelization (2007 – 2009). For ease of ministry and effective outreach, the changes also led to the parish being divided into two pastoral regions: <br>
<ol>
  <li>Adams Pastoral Region covering Woodley, Jamhuri and Kilimani sub-regions. 70% of the parish territory falls within this region which forms 50% of the parish population.  </li>
  <li>Kibera Pastoral Region comprising of Makina, Gatwekera, Olympic and Kianda sub-regions. This region holds the other half of the parish population within the remaining 30% territory of the parish.</li>

</ol> <br>
Generally, the fundamental structure of Our Lady of Guadalupe Parish is based on Small Christian Communities, ecclesial groups and apostolic associations. The two main Councils are the Parish Pastoral Council (PPC) and the Parish Pastoral Team (PPT). PPC is a consultative organ that helps in fostering pastoral activities in our parish.  Whereas members of SCC move on to elect PPC, liturgical groups do not hold leadership in the Council but serve in all liturgical functions under the guidance of the Parish Priest.  <br>
PPT on the other hand is formed by the Parish Priests who appoint members.  In addition to serving as an advisory body to the Priests on pastoral matters, the team also co-ordinates pastoral-related activities. <br>
The parish has three ministries namely, Pastoral, Social and Administration. Each has different departments that help with implementation of the strategic plans of action. <br>

Social Ministry responds to social, economic, political and cultural issues both within and outside Parish. Pastoral Ministry deals with the spiritual formation of parishioners at various levels and different cadres. Co-ordinated by the Father In-Charge, Administration Ministry is the overall organ that oversees day to day operation of the parish.<br>
overall organ that oversees day to day operation of the parish.
The Father In-Charge is the Chairman of all church groups and Administrator of all Parish departments as stipulated in the Canon Law and the pastoral guidelines of the Archdiocese of Nairobi. <br>

With the involvement of parishioners, the Parish formulates a periodic Strategic Plan of Evangelization complete with a vision, mission, goals and objectives in implementing her activities. The activities are evaluated annually; setting pace for the following plan of action. <br>
